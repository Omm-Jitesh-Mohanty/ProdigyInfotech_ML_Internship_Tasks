# ProdigyInfotech_ML_Internship_Tasks

This repository showcases my codes of the task given by PRODIGY INFOTECH in their Machine Learning internship. The tasks are as follows:

Task-01 Implement a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. Dataset : - https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

Task-02 Create a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python

Task-03 Implement a support vector machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs from the Kaggle dataset. Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data

Task-04 Comillas Negras ProDigy infotech Develop a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog

Task-05 Comillas Negras Develop a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101
